* Overall goal
My overall goal is to make a flake structure that is easy to reason about and manage.
I want to easily be able to switch desktop environment and keep the changes I have made. These changes should also be keeped from machine to machine. Plasma should be in dark mode right of the bat.
I need these machine to do actuel and because of this I need an TTS and a STT. 


** TTS

** DOOM emacs and ChadVim

** core and optional config
